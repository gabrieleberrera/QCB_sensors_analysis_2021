# QCB_sensors_analysis_2021

In this repository are collected some machine learning and deep learning solutions applicable for classification of sensors data.
These models were tested on three different cases of study:

- Human Activity Recognition
- Parkinson's Disease preliminary detection
- ECG diagnostical classification

The dataset employed for the evaluation can be found at the following links:

- UCI HAR dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones
- mPower dataset: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4993293/wiki/247860
- PTB-XL dataset: https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/

For the deep learning solutions the Python Notebooks were designed to work in the Google Colab environment, allowing to allocate resourecs on a GPU device.
